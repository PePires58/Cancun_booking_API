This is a .NET based project. Use C# coding conventions and best practices when generating code.

## Code Standards

### Development Flow

- Test: Use `dotnet test` to run unit tests.
- Run: Use `dotnet run` to execute the application locally.

## Repository Structure

## Code Style

- Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes and methods, camelCase for local variables and parameters).
- Use explicit access modifiers (public, private, protected) for all classes and members.
- Use `var` for local variable declarations when the type is obvious from the right-hand side.
- Implement proper exception handling using try-catch blocks where necessary.
- Follow SOLID principles for object-oriented design.
